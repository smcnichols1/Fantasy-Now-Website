        Easy start this week as Leonard Fournette matches up with a defense that's in the spirit of giving with
        all the rushing yards they allow to the offense. The LSU alum should be able to get going fast and the 
        early lead they jump out to should secure a game plan that sticks to the run game. If you have this guy,
        you're playing him.

        Weren't expecting him were ya? Mike Evans has had at least 50 yards in every game this season but he hasn't had
        a game shape up like this either. His quarterback is out with a shoulder injury, the back-up, has more
        career interceptions than touchdowns. I don't trust him. Not to mention Evans will be matching up with
        veteran corner, Richard Sherman. If you have this Bucaneer, consider sitting him this week.
